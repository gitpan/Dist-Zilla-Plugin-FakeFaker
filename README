NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FakeFaker - Because sometimes you just have to fake
    it

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini

      [FakeFaker]

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FakeFaker is a Dist::Zilla plugin for those
    situations where one has already got a "Makefile.PL" file of one's own
    that has been lovingly handcrafted to do funky things and one wishes to
    "leverage" the power of Dist::Zilla.

    Instead of specifying "[MakeMaker]" in one's "dist.ini", just specify
    "[FakeFaker]" and your "Makefile.PL" will be used.

METHODS
    "setup_installer"
        This is basically a no-op and merely returns without creating a
        "Makefile.PL".
